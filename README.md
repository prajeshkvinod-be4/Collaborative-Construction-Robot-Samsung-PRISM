# Collaborative-Construction-Robot-Samsung-PRISM
Developed a robotic construction framework where two 4-DOF robotic arms autonomously assembled a 3×3 block grid, demonstrating automation in construction tasks. • Implemented synchronization strategies using Arduino Uno and Raspberry Pi, achieving over 80% block placement accuracy during autonomous 3×3 grid trials.
